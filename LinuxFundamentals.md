# üêß Linux Fundamentals on TryHackMe

After completing my first task on TryHackMe, I moved on to the **Linux Fundamentals** modules (Part 1, 2, and 3). This section was one of my favorites so far because it gave me a chance to work directly with a **virtual machine (VM)** and practice real Linux commands hands-on.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs been a little while since my last post ‚Äî I got busy with other commitments, so this update came a bit later than planned. But I‚Äôm back on track now and documenting my progress again!

### üîπ What I Learned
- **Part 1**: Basic Linux commands and navigation  
  - Listing files and directories (`ls`, `pwd`)  
  - Moving around with `cd`  
  - Creating/removing files and directories (`touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`)  

- **Part 2**: Intermediate usage  
  - Working with SSH to log into a Linux machine  
  - Exploring the file system  
  - Using commands like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `grep`  

- **Part 3**: Utilities for everyday tasks  
  - File permissions and the use of `chmod`, `chown`  
  - Process management with `ps`, `top`, `kill`  
  - Useful shortcuts and pipes (`|`)

### üí° Reflection
I actually really enjoyed this section because the **interactive VM** reminded me of what I had studied during my **Wireless Information Networking diploma** ‚Äî it felt like a good **refresher of all the Linux basics**. Doing it in a hands-on way (rather than just reading) made it stick much better.

### ‚úÖ Next Steps
I‚Äôll continue with the **Windows and AD Fundamentals** module next, and update my GitHub with progress as I go. My goal is to build a complete record of my cybersecurity learning journey, module by module.
