# cybersecurity-learning-journey
A personal log of my TryHackMe rooms, notes, and cybersecurity learning journey.
Welcome! 👋  
This is my personal log of all the **TryHackMe rooms**, notes, and milestones from my cybersecurity learning journey.

## 🌟 Why I Created This Repo
I wanted a place to:
- ✍️ Write down what I learn in each room.
- 📌 Track my progress over time.
- 🤝 Share my notes with others who are also learning.

## 🧭 My Notes & Reflection on Banner Room Tasks

I’ve been working through the **Banner – Cyber Security 101** room on TryHackMe, and here’s how I went through each task.  
I explored all the links mentioned and tried to do as much research as I could. It turned out to be a very interesting and knowledgeable experience — I really got to see how these concepts connect in the real world. ✨

---

### ✅ Task 1: Introduction
Got an overview of why search skills are so important in cybersecurity.  
It set the tone for the rest of the room and made me excited to dive in.

---

### ✅ Task 2: Evaluation of Search Results
Learned to look beyond the first search result.  
Now I pay more attention to the source, date, and reliability of information.

---

### ✅ Task 3: Search Engines
Explored different search engines and realized how much better results can get when you know how to use operators and filters.

---

### ✅ Task 4: Specialized Search Engines
This part was eye‑opening!  
I discovered tools like **Shodan** and other niche search engines that security professionals actually use.  
It showed me how much power these tools have when you need very specific data.

---

### ✅ Task 5: Vulnerabilities and Exploits
Dove into CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and learned how they’re documented.  
It’s amazing how every known vulnerability is tracked with an ID, making research and communication much easier.

---

### ✅ Task 6: Technical Documentation
I used to get intimidated by docs, but this task helped me see them as guides instead of walls of text.  
It’s all about knowing how to skim and pick out what you need.

---

### ✅ Task 7: Social Media
I never thought social media would be useful for research, but it really is!  
Following the right people or communities can lead to quick updates on new threats or tools.

---

### ✅ Task 8: Conclusion
All these tasks tied together beautifully.  
After going through the resources and links, I feel like I’ve built a solid foundation on how to search, research, and think like someone in cybersecurity.

**💡 Final thoughts:**  
> This room was more than just a lesson — it was a mindset shift.  
> I now understand how things can run behind the scenes and how powerful proper research can be.

I’m excited to keep building on this knowledge and document more as I go! 🚀
