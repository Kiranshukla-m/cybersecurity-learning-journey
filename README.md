# 🚀 Cybersecurity Learning Journey  

A personal log of my **TryHackMe rooms, notes, and cybersecurity learning journey**. Welcome! 👋  

This repository is where I document each module I complete, along with reflections, commands I practiced, and lessons I learned.

## 📂 Progress So Far  

1. [🐧 Linux Fundamentals](./LinuxFundamentals.md)  
   - Learned to navigate the Linux OS, work with files, directories, SSH, permissions, and processes.  
   - Refreshed my memory from my **Wireless Information Networking diploma**.  

2. [🪟 Windows & Active Directory Fundamentals](./WindowsFundamentals.md)  
   - Explored NTFS, UAC, Control Panel, Registry, BitLocker, and AD basics.  
   - Understood how **restrictions, permissions, and access control** are applied in organizations.  

3. [💻 Windows Command Line](./WindowsCommandLine.md)  
   - Gained confidence with essential commands: `ping`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `tasklist`, `taskkill`, `dir`, etc.  
   - Realized that **every click in the GUI is just a command in the background**.
