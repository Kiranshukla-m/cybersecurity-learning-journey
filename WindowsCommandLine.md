# ðŸ’» Windows Command Line on TryHackMe  

After completing the Windows & AD Fundamentals, I jumped into the **Windows Command Line** module. This was a great experience because it made me much more confident about using command lines directly instead of relying on the graphical interface.

### ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
- **Introduction**  
  - Importance of the command line for system administrators and security professionals.  

- **Basic System Information**  
  - Learned commands to check system details, hostname, and environment variables.  

- **Network Troubleshooting**  
  - Practiced commands like `ping`, `ipconfig`, and `netstat` to understand and troubleshoot network connectivity.  

- **File and Disk Management**  
  - Managed files and directories with commands like `dir`, `cd`, `copy`, `del`.  
  - Learned how to navigate between directories and organize file structures efficiently.  

- **Task and Process Management**  
  - Explored commands to view and manage running processes (`tasklist`, `taskkill`).  
  - Understood how to monitor system performance and handle misbehaving applications.

### ðŸ’¡ Reflection  
Normally, we feel comfortable with the **graphical user interface (GUI)** because itâ€™s visual and easy to navigate. But working with the **command line** helped me realize that the **real processes happen behind the UI**.  

Now I understand:  
- Each click in the UI translates to an actual command being executed.  
- Knowing these commands gives **direct control** and makes troubleshooting more efficient.  
- Command line knowledge builds the mindset of a **system admin/security analyst** instead of just a regular user.  

This gave me a **deeper confidence** in handling Windows systems beyond the surface level.

### âœ… Next Steps  
Since **PowerShell** and **Linux Shells** are premium modules that I donâ€™t have access to, Iâ€™ll keep practicing the Windows commands I learned and gradually explore PowerShell basics through other free resources. My goal is to strengthen automation and scripting skills alongside cybersecurity labs.
