# ðŸªŸ Windows & AD Fundamentals on TryHackMe  

After finishing the Linux modules, I moved on to **Windows & Active Directory Fundamentals**. Even though Iâ€™ve been using Windows my whole life, this was the first time I looked at it **deeply from a cybersecurity and system administration perspective**.

### ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
- **Windows Fundamentals 1**:  
  - NTFS file system basics  
  - User Account Control (UAC)  
  - Control Panel and system configurations  

- **Windows Fundamentals 2**:  
  - System Configuration tools  
  - UAC settings and resource monitoring  
  - Windows Registry and deeper system interactions  

- **Windows Fundamentals 3**:  
  - Built-in Microsoft security tools  
  - Windows Updates and Security Center  
  - BitLocker and keeping devices secure  

- **Active Directory Basics**:  
  - User accounts, groups, and permissions  
  - The role of a Domain Controller  
  - How AD manages authentication and access

### ðŸ’¡ Reflection
Working through this section made me realize how much happens **behind the scenes** in Windows.  

When I was working in an organization before, I often saw restrictions â€” like which apps we could install, which settings were locked, and who could access certain files. At that time, I didnâ€™t fully understand *why* those controls were there.  

Now, I see clearly:  
- **User accounts and group policies** are designed to make sure people have **just enough access** to do their jobs.  
- Admins can track who accessed what and when, and this is critical for **security and accountability**.  
- Access control isnâ€™t just about restriction â€” itâ€™s about balance: giving each person what they need, without exposing the system to unnecessary risk.  

This deeper look into Windows and AD gave me the **perspective of a system administrator/security analyst** rather than just an end user.

### âœ… Next Steps
Iâ€™ll continue building on these fundamentals as I go into more advanced topics. My next focus will be to explore **command line and PowerShell** tasks to strengthen my hands-on Windows security skills.
